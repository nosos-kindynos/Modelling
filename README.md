# Modelling Transmission Dynamics

hence based on the social interaction we assign the relationship a one on one tranfer chance , which is the probability of the transfer of the disease to the other if one happens to posses it.

The one on one tranfer chance is calculated by assigning the relationship a tranfer factor , which is the ratio of the one on one transfer chance of this relationship to the average one one one transfer chance of a particular diease , also referred to as the reproduction number (R0) in epidemology.
