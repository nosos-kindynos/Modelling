# Modelling Transmission Dynamics

This project models transmission dynamics based on the user inputed social interaction.Based on the one on one relationship , we assign the relationship a one on one tranfer chance , which is the probability of the transfer of the disease from either to the other if one happens to be infected by it.

The one on one tranfer chance is calculated by assigning the relationship a transfer factor , which is the ratio of the one on one transfer chance of this relationship to the average one on one transfer chance of a particular disease , also referred to as the reproduction number (R0) in epidemology.
